# Church resources audit

Inspected 2026-09-12, America/Los_Angeles. This is a read-only product/source/deployment audit plus additive planning files. No application feature, server migration, account setting, or release was deployed.

## Repository baseline

The three GitHub heads below were checked with `git ls-remote --heads`. Local source inspection also used the indicated feature refs, rather than assuming that each primary checkout was current.

| Repository | GitHub main | Relevant integration ref | Primary working folder before this audit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Heritage | `74ce66a6488a077471a755618f8d32463d31ba7a` | `codex/community-progress-sync` at `ef9574d5227b41c1450f6ece86a1d3fa902b8045` | `codex/syncshow-community-integration` at `711d834`, 145 changed/untracked status entries |
| SyncShow | `c95f97d23d88b663101f7cd11008bc1b11b30032` | `codex/settings-tabs-prepare-workflow` at `9c616b8ac16850c6238b1078f7ccabd6b22674ae` | `codex/syncshow-foundation` at `159fbf3`, 84 changed/untracked status entries |
| Multilinguum | `a825169ea2faacbf854814e29743c84c02090868` | same main | clean |

The current SyncShow feature ref declares `1.4.0-preview.24`. That observation is a source version, not a new verification of signed release assets or the installed app. Several registered temporary worktrees were marked prunable because their folders were absent. Their absence does not mean all earlier changes were merged.

Heritage main and its personal-sync feature ref differ across 274 files, including generated/vendor material. The raw size is not a measure of code quality. It does show why a new feature should not be based on the primary folder or main without reconciling the integration baseline.

No reset, clean, stash, checkout change, pull, merge, commit, or remote repository mutation was performed. Existing uncommitted files were preserved.

## What exists

| Area | Evidence inspected | Remaining boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Native preparation and display | SyncShow roadmap, service contracts, current feature package, scene/display paths; Heritage `ServiceDocuments`, `PlanServiceClient`, and `@syncshow/service-core` | No new packaged-app or physical-display rehearsal in this audit. |
| Shared songs and sermon resources | Heritage member sharing/publication endpoints, `PassageSermonsPanel`, `PublishedSermonArchivePage`; SyncShow integration docs | Library and publication code exist; a complete weekly service workflow was not newly exercised. |
| Personal notes and progress | Feature-ref `src/services/progressSync.js`, account/sync endpoints, record collections, and `community-server/docs/PERSONAL_PROGRESS_SYNC.md` | Real email delivery and a two-device sync session were not tested here. Discovery capability flags alone do not establish those results. |
| Live translation | Multilinguum protocol, session engine, realtime capture, cascade, listener, worker, deployment, implementation-status and benchmark docs | English/Russian source types exist; full bilingual real-service quality/latency acceptance is still required. |
| Existing Heritage translation page | Feature-ref `community-server/src/app/(frontend)/live/page.tsx`; live HTTP and browser checks | Current integration is an external listener embed, without the proposed shared native control surface. |
| SyncShow live caption integration | Focused searches on the current SyncShow feature ref for Multilinguum, ticker, chyron, and live translation | No implementation found in the inspected source paths. Bible-version/song translation features are separate. |

Personal-sync documentation specifies server-authorized encryption at rest, not end-to-end encryption. It includes manual **Sync now**, independent records, conflicts and tombstones, device revocation, and optional strict protection. The user experience should not promise invisible continuous cross-device sync before that behavior is implemented and verified.

## Live public checks

All checks used public URLs and did not start a translation session or send audio.

| URL | Observed result |
| --- | --- |
| `https://wotbc.heritage.faith/.well-known/heritage-community.json` | HTTP 200. Advertises songs, sharing links, sermons, sermon media/publications, service plans/documents, and personal-progress/account capabilities. No live-translation capability advertised. |
| `https://wotbc.heritage.faith/translate` | HTTP 404. |
| `https://wotbc.heritage.faith/live` | HTTP 200. Browser rendered the external listener and its “No service is live” state. |
| `https://translate.mayos.dev/` | HTTP 200. Deployed CSP includes `frame-ancestors 'self' https://wotbc.heritage.faith`; no X-Frame-Options denial was returned in the checked response. |
| `https://translate.mayos.dev/api/public/service` | HTTP 200; `active: false`, church name `Word of Truth`, empty language list. |

The committed Multilinguum edge source instead sets `x-frame-options: DENY` and lacks the deployed `frame-ancestors` value. This is a confirmed source/deployment discrepancy, not proof of a presently broken live iframe. The actual embedded inactive listener rendered successfully. The exact deployed processor/edge commits were not established by these public checks.

WOTBC's discovery response is evidence of exposed capabilities, not proof of authenticated write operations, SMTP, database migration integrity, available machine capacity, or complete sync behavior. No SSH/GPU-host changes or host identity assumptions were made.

## Concrete translation gaps

1. `packages/protocol/src/types.ts` and `schemas.ts` have voice modes `source`, `natural`, and `cloned`; there is no explicit speech-disabled translation mode.
2. `services/processor/src/session-engine.ts`, near `#processChannel`, returns immediately for `muted` channels. Ordinary translated clauses flow through `#enqueueSpeech`; captions are published after a speech render and playout schedule are available. Muting is not a text-only implementation.
3. `realtime-capture-pipeline.ts` starts direct translation sessions for enabled natural-voice targets. This path generates audio as well as text. A text-only mode must route through transcription and text translation or another provider with a verified text-only contract.
4. `apps/listener/src/caption-timeline.ts` already supports segments without `playout`. Reuse that facility to display immediate finalized captions, while keeping audio-follow timing for listeners who want it.
5. `BroadcastMediaRelay` already broadcasts text without LiveKit, but its audio method is a no-op. It must not be treated as proof that speech is delivered.
6. `compose.yaml` unconditionally makes the processor depend on the CUDA voice worker. Production configuration also checks a voice-worker token regardless of use. These are deployment dependencies to remove for cloud/text-only operation, not inherent GPU requirements.
7. `config.ts` exposes one `OPENAI_API_KEY` across cloud stages. Selecting a text model does not select a different sharing policy; stage-specific project configuration is needed if only eligible text traffic should be shared.
8. `packages/protocol/src/cost.ts` uses fixed realtime per-minute planning rates even for cascade channels. It does not meter actual token/TTS usage or know the remaining account-wide allowance.
9. The listener uses root-absolute public API paths, and the edge exposes an explicit public allowlist. A same-origin Community integration needs deliberate base-path/proxy handling, not just a copied iframe URL.

Multilinguum's README is older than its implementation-status document: the README says realtime adapters are still a spike, while the source and newer status document show them wired into capture. Several older status entries also conflict with later additions. Treat the source plus dated observations as the baseline and update these documents during reconciliation.

## Reference and external facts

The supplied [YouTube reference at 41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4KK3HjeXY&t=2463s) was opened in the browser. The frame shows large multi-line Russian text over the pulpit video, with older lines subdued and the current line brighter. The useful design reference is the readable rolling text; the proposed church display omits the camera image as requested. This was a visual inspection, not a latency or translation-accuracy assessment of that service.

OpenAI's current [shared-data offer](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10306912-sharing-feedback-evaluation-and-fine-tuning-data-and-api-inputs-and-outputs-with-openai) was opened. Eligibility, project opt-in, eligible model groups, daily quota, and billable crossing requests are documented. The audit did not inspect the user's signed-in billing settings or change sharing. The Multilinguum [August benchmark](https://github.com/edydex/multilinguum/blob/a825169ea2faacbf854814e29743c84c02090868/docs/benchmarks/2026-08-29-openai-ru-en.md) records a small synthetic Terra request that previously received complimentary usage; this is historical evidence, not a current eligibility check.

Current documentation also lists [Live Transcribe](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-live-transcribe) at $0.017/minute and [Realtime Translate](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-realtime-translate) at $0.034/minute. [Ordinary TTS](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/text-to-speech) is a cloud API operation. These support cohosting without a local GPU, but do not demonstrate WOTBC capacity or model performance on this church's audio.

The existing benchmark records a direct-realtime translation accuracy failure on meaning-sensitive phrases and a better glossary-aware text result. It supports retaining a measured text translation stage for sermons; it does not establish comparative performance of newer untested models.

## Deliverables and next execution boundary

Added a shared product brief, this audit, a focused translation integration outline, and a navigation-only workspace file. An accompanying inline design preview illustrates display modes using authored example text. The preview is not connected to a microphone, model API, server, or physical display.

Validation of these deliverables: all workspace folders and relative document links resolve; document whitespace checks and preview JavaScript syntax passed. Browser inspection verified the full-screen feed, Russian lower third, ticker/sample advance, voice selection, and screen-text-off state. The lower third was also inspected at 360px width. These checks validate the preview controls and layout, not the future translation pipeline.

Application integration remains to implement. Begin by reproducing the actual pilot baseline in clean checkouts and then deliver the text-only `/translate` path. Existing deployments and source branches should be reconciled before changing the current live integration or retiring a processor host. Keep venue acceptance, email delivery, and two-device sync clearly separate from code-level checks.
